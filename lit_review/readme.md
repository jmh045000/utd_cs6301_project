* IEEE
* another paper by the initial author
* describes design of Construct3D

> In fact, Bowman [4] and other studies suggest that for direct input in 3D space six degrees of freedom are not expedient most of the time. Therefore it is very reasonable to restrict the userâ€™s input to two dimensions for instance.  Commonly grids and snapping functions are used to enable exact modeling.
