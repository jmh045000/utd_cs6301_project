VR WorldBuilder project



Project Description
===================
#6 World Builder
In the year 2007, filmmaker Bruce Branit released a seminal science fiction
film called the "World Builder", which shows a futuristic user interface that
enables a user to build an entire virtual world in a computer program:

The goal of this project is to implement a "world builder" interface that
enables a user to create a virtual 3D environment from scratch in the most
efficient way while not limiting the user's abilities. The user interface should
minimally enable a user to navigate in the virtual scene, as well as create,
select, and manipulate (translate, rotate, scale, and texture) simple virtual
objects (constructed or prefabricated).

Expectations:
Immersive computer-aided design (CAD) applications have been developed before,
including the Construct3D application [1], but  most not for the purpose of
"world building". The expectations of this project are 1) the identification of
the functionalities supported in prior CAD-like applications, 2) the conception
of new functionalities meant specifically for world building, 3) the design of
an immersive 3D user interface (3DUI) that incorporates both old and new
functionalities, and 4) the development of a prototype of the designed 3DUI with
a subset of working functionalities (enough to recreate a famous landmark). The
prototype can be developed in any API, though it is highly recommended that the
Syzygy library be used.
