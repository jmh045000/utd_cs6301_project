People have a dream of building their own world.While it may not be possible in real life, it is possible through virtual reality.
We describe a world builder system (WBS) which is based on Bruce Branit's seminal science fiction film called the "World Builder" where people can build their own world.
The idea behind the world builder concept is simple: create a world in which the user can craft other worlds.
The World Builder was built using the Syzygy API and arMasterSlaveFramework.
We provide three interaction techniques (Selection,Manipulation and Navigation).
The interaction is done with the Head-Mounted Display and two 6 Degree of Freedom (6DOF) Wiimotes using concepts such as Virtual Hand, Ray Casting, PORT, real walking, and virtual walking.
Manipulation is done through both a menu interace and gestures allowing users to create, delete, texture, move, rotate, and scale objects.
This project allows a user to design a virtual world around themselves, enabling the user to easily bring to life their imagination.
