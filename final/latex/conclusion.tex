The envisioned applications of the world builder are many including CAD and Educational Institutions.We wanted and Intuitive, easy to use interface in order to make it easily usable by a diverse range of people.Hence in our Testing Team we included external testers to get their perspective. From the  Feedback and observation, we made several improvements to the user interface in order to make the application,more easy to use.During our latest usability evaluation,we found that users averaged under 5 minutes to do basic operations like object creations,texturing and under 10 minutes to do  complex operations like grouping.We  observed that precise Object Placement was difficult and took more time than what the users expected. However The testing sample was small and we plan to have more users  test our application and improve our application iteratively based on feedback.
Since our application uses HMD,we recommend limiting sessions to 20-30 minutes to avoid simulator sickness 
We believe that several enhancements can be made to our software  in future including Sound Creation and Manipulation ,Light Creation and Manipulation,Haptic Feedback
and Simulation Effects like Gravity, wind, water, electrical, friction and collision detection to make the virtual world more realistic.
