The envisioned applications of the world builder are many including CAD and Educational Institutions.
We wanted an intuitive and easy to use interface in order to make it easily usable by a diverse range of people.
Hence our testers included external testers to get their perspective.
From the  Feedback and observation, we made several improvements to the user interface in order to make the application easier to use.
During our latest usability evaluation, we found that users averaged under 5 minutes to do basic operations like object creation and texturing, and under 10 minutes to do complex operations like grouping.
We observed that precise object placement was difficult and took more time than the users expected.
However, the testing sample was small and we plan to have more users test our application and improve our application iteratively based on feedback.
Since our application uses a HMD, we recommend limiting sessions to less than 30 minutes to avoid simulator sickness \cite{Kaufmann:Usability}.
We believe that several enhancements can be made to our software in future including Sound Creation and Manipulation, Light Creation and Manipulation, Haptic Feedback, and Simulation Effects like gravity, wind, water, electrical, friction, and collision detection to make the virtual world more realistic.
