We had 8 people,including  3 external testers (a child, a male, and a female participant who had no prior VR Experience) test our application.

Some of the changes we made based on feedback and observation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item changed the menu to 2D interface to make it more user friendly.
  \item switched to ray casting to facilitate easier grabbing.
  \item Reset Scale was added as people had problems in resetting the scale.
  \item fixed rotation to make it more intuitive
\end{itemize}
