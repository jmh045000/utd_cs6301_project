We had 8 people,including  3 external testers (a child,a male and a female participant)who had no prior VR Experience test our application.
Some of the changes we made based on feedback and observation :
  * changed the menu to 2D interface to make it more user friendly.
  * switched to ray casting to facilitate easier grabbing.
  * Reset Scale was added as people had problems in resetting the scale.
  * fixed rotation to make it more intuitive
