We had 8 people, including 3 external testers, use our application.  The three external testers were a child and two adults.  None of our external testers had prior VR Experience.  
Some of the changes we made based on feedback and observation include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item changing the menu to 2D interface to make it more user friendly.
  \item implementing Virtual Hand Casting to facilitate easier grabbing as well as precise manipulation
  \item adding Reset Scale to the menu because multiple testers had problems resetting the scale back to 1:1
  \item fixing rotation to make it more intuitive
\end{itemize}
