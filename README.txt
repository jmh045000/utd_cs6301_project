This project must be run in the same directory with the worldbuilder_rsc as well as the .obj files and .jpg files used as base objects and textures.

To Use:
You can navigate using the D-Pad on either WiiMote.  This will move you in the direction that WiiMote is pointing (if you press 'UP' on both WiiMotes while they're pointing in opposite directions, you won't move).
If you press both 'HOME' keys at the same time, a help screen will be presented, which can be exited with 'A'.
