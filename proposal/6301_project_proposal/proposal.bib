More specifically, we present a system that uses collaborative augmented reality as a medium for teaching, and uses 3D dynamic geometry to facilitate mathematics and geometry education. Both these aspects are novel to geometry education. We describe improvements in the user interface and visual design of such an application. We also report on practical experiences with using our system for actual teaching of high school students, and present initial quantitative data on the educational value of such an approach.},

abstract={Interaction inside virtual reality applications begins usually with simple selection tasks that can be achieved with moderate degrees of performances. More complex operations like modeling or sculpting inside an immersive environment raises however increased needs for precise 3D selections and visual feedback. In a modeling context any 3D location must be targetable, even ones that are outside of initial reach or not graphically represented. Common interaction techniques in virtual reality do not fullfill these goals without switching between different tools. We present an extensive and precise selection technique called the 3D arrow, used for moving and sculpting inside an immersive terrain modeling application. Composed of a graphic mouse-like pointer constrained inside a workspace defined by the region of space at arm's reach, the 3D arrow allow the users to seamlessly reach and target any position of space within the same interaction paradigm and to rotate the view around the pointer. The graphic appearance of the pointer is carefully designed to help users estimate its global and local position in the terrain scenery.},

It provides a roadmap for future augmented reality research which will be of great value to this relatively young field, and also for helping researchers decide which topics should be explored when they are beginning their own studies in the area.},

abstract={Solid evidence of virtual reality's benefits has graduated from impressive visual demonstrations to producing results in practical applications. Further, a realistic experience is no longer immersion's sole asset. Empirical studies show that various components of immersion provide other benefits - full immersion is not always necessary. The goal of immersive virtual environments (VEs) was to let the user experience a computer-generated world as if it were real - producing a sense of presence, or "being there," in the user's mind.},
