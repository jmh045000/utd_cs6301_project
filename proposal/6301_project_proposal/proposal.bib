abstract={We present Virtual Notepad, a collection of interface tools that allows the user to take notes, annotate documents and input text using a pen, while still immersed in virtual environments (VEs). Using a spatially-tracked, pressure-sensitive graphics tablet, pen and handwriting recognition software, Virtual Notepad explores handwriting as a new modality for interaction in immersive VEs. This paper reports details of the Virtual Notepad interface and interaction techniques, discusses implementation and design issues, reports the results of initial evaluation and overviews possible applications of virtual handwriting.},

abstract={ Our work introduces immersive collaborative learning to geometry education. More specifically, we present a system that uses collaborative augmented reality as a medium for teaching, and uses 3D dynamic geometry to facilitate mathematics and geometry education. Both these aspects are novel to geometry education. We describe improvements in the user interface and visual design of such an application. We also report on practical experiences with using our system for actual teaching of high school students, and present initial quantitative data on the educational value of such an approach.},
