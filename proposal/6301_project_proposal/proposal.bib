abstract={Interaction inside virtual reality applications begins usually with simple selection tasks that can be achieved with moderate degrees of performances. More complex operations like modeling or sculpting inside an immersive environment raises however increased needs for precise 3D selections and visual feedback. In a modeling context any 3D location must be targetable, even ones that are outside of initial reach or not graphically represented. Common interaction techniques in virtual reality do not fullfill these goals without switching between different tools. We present an extensive and precise selection technique called the 3D arrow, used for moving and sculpting inside an immersive terrain modeling application. Composed of a graphic mouse-like pointer constrained inside a workspace defined by the region of space at arm's reach, the 3D arrow allow the users to seamlessly reach and target any position of space within the same interaction paradigm and to rotate the view around the pointer. The graphic appearance of the pointer is carefully designed to help users estimate its global and local position in the terrain scenery.},

Further, a realistic experience is no longer immersion's sole asset. Empirical studies show that various components of immersion provide other benefits - full immersion is not always necessary.

There were lots of demos and pilot systems, but except for vehicle simulators and entertainment applications, VR was not yet in production use doing real work. This year he was invited to do an up-to-date assessment of VR, with funding to visit major centers in North America and Europe. Every one of the component technologies has made big strides. Moreover, I found that there now exist some VR applications routinely operated for the results they produce.},

An experimental teaching programme involving undergraduate architectural students at the University of Luton, in which aspects of compositional theory are explored through the direct creation of architectural form and space in digital formats is described. In the programme principles of architectural composition, based upon the ordering and organisation of typological architectural elements according to established rules of composition are introduced to the students through the study of recognised works of design theory. CAD and desktop virtual reality are then used to define and manipulate architectural elements, and to make formal and spatial evaluations of the environments created. The paper describes the theoretical context of the work, assesses the suitability of the software used for performing compositional manipulations, and evaluates the qualities of immersion and intuitive feedback which virtual reality based modelling can offer in the design visualisation process. The teaching programme utilises standard software packages, including AutoCAD, and 3D Studio, as well as Superscape VRT, a PC based desktop VR package},

abstract={The article describes the use of virtual reality techniques during the car development process at Volkswagen. A brief definition of virtual reality is given and it is pointed out that virtual reality has to be understood as a method and not only as a tool. There is a short introduction of the research topics that are investigated by the VR-Lab. Some of them are presented in more detail. It is shown which steps have to be taken to get a virtual reality design review model. The problems are pointed out and possible solutions are described. An interface to the 3D human model, RAMSIS, has been implemented. RAMSIS is the result of a joint venture of German car companies and two seat manufacturers. The goal of implementing RAMSIS was to generate a realistic simulation of human beings in car interiors and work places. The integration of the CAD geometry kernel, ACIS, enhances the analytical possibilities of the virtual reality system by adding the same parametric surfaces used by the original CAD system and providing a wide variety of CAD functionality (e.g. cutting planes, distance measuring, Boolean operations). A 3D interaction model for modifying colors and surface structures of car interiors provides an easy and intuitive access to the geometric models concerned. Arbitrary components can be selected freely within the virtual environment and they can be manipulated ldquo;by a wave rdquo; of the hand},

In many cases the problem is that the CAD human-machine interface fails to preserve the metaphors and idioms of the traditional studio. Historically, human utility has been seen as a less-important resource than computing power, and users' needs have been sacrificed to make computer use even possible. Now, computer power is cheap, and looks to become ever cheaper: perhaps now we can afford to make computersystems versatile for their users, and not make the users ingenious for their computers. This paper examines how vastly cheaper computing power might be used to make stylists' lives more pleasant."

Firstly, top-down and bottom-up hybrid design process based on IP library is proposed. It facilitates and speeds up design cycle and reduces the expense of MEMS design by using IP components which have been successfully implemented. Secondly, virtual fabrication process is proposed. It is used to establish stable, accurate and robust 3D geometry of device according to the fabrication process. Voxel-based visualization technique is applied to virtual fabrication process to achieve better process simulation result. It could help designers achieve highly accurate fabrication process and result. Thirdly, virtual operation is proposed. It is used to visualize and simulate the mechanical operation of MEMS device. This module could exhibit 3D realistic animation in virtual reality (VR) environment. It could help designers achieve highly accurate physical operation characteristic of MEMS device. With the help of virtual fabrication process and virtual operation, intuitive image and realistic animation of MEMS device is exhibited at the design stage.
